When refreshing /signin, it auto signs in 
and a reducer .errors is not iterable message

Think about store.clear() / when to clear all sessions / should I clear all sessions? / 

confirmAccount is used to sign users up.
confirmAccount can be used for reseting a users password as it's the same process
of validating a token and confirming. 
Think about creaklefal the logic to sdisdl in an IF ELSE!

When on the confirm account page, I signed out and it displayed a new message saying "There was an errors
confirming your account" etc.... Make it so that message doens't show on sign out.

The returned user fromt he server the values within it think what needs to be returned
Maybe just accountConfirmed and similiar non threatening values instead of their
email and username and personal things.

The measurements [], created when creating a new user, should be on client side, passed as measurements to Measurements, passed
as a user property when creating a new user.
